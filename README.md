[Post on r/polybar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polybar/comments/k9oc84/consistent_theming_with_ayu_colors_merges_with/). Opened in Firefox. Notice how the Firefox tabs bar merge in with the Polybar. Firefox is following GTK theme.

(Actually its Waterfox, not Firefox)

## Random Things to Know
  * Fonts definitions in my Polybar are a mess. It works. And its still an unsolved mystery as to why it works.
  * The only thing you want to copy from my i3 config are the color definitions.
  * Ayu Mirage colorscheme is used everywhere.
  * You also want to install Papirus Icons.
  * I use EndeavourOS. Its great. Try it out someday.
  * Ayu Theme for various apps (VSCode, Sublime Text, vim etc.) can be found [here](https://github.com/ayu-theme)
